# Project Background
An improvement on the existing OBA architecture so that the users i.e., the professors who are using said software to collect data on students and classes are able to do so more efficiently. Additionally, making it easier for the administrators to collect and corroborate data in a more structured and accurate manner. Some of the instructors have trouble collecting the data needed for OBA. Others have trouble understanding it. Getting the data required or in some cases getting errant data which they have to manually sort through is a challenge. With this project we hope to alleviate and streamline the data collection process for our target customers.
# Northstar Customers
The professors and instructors who are using the application to submit data.
# Carryover Customers
The administrators who are collecting and compiling data to be sent for accreditations.
Regulatory bodies using the data to accredit institutions.
# Project Assumptions
We have been asked to use a content management system (WordPress).
We are taking the opinion of the instructors to be the norm for the entire faculty.
Regulatory bodies have approved the changes proposed.
# Project Constraints
Not being able to use a lot of premium features.
Lack of wide data pool.
Vagueness and complexity of the OBA restricts efficient brainstorming.
Having to use an unfamiliar programming environment.
Having to use a content management system.
